According to the research content, the series of original data are obtained first.The original data were normalized to obtain an independent normal random variable with mean of 0 and variance of 1.KMO and Bartlett tests were carried out on SPSS. After the results were obtained, the common factor variance with poor values was eliminated to make the KMO value higher, which laid a foundation for the subsequent principal component analysis.Perform principal component analysis on the optimized data.The principal component coefficients (eigenvectors of the matrix) are obtained from the load matrix.The principal component matrix is obtained by multiplying the principal component coefficients by the original data.The obtained principal component matrix was analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis and clustering analysis to get the box office prediction equation and the influencing factors after clustering.
